Encapsulation --> Wrapping up the data members and function members under the 
same unit is known as encapsulation. 

Q1. what is fully encapsulated class --> A class in which all the data members 
are private and can be accessed only within the class. The following is the an 
example of fully encapsulated class.

class Hero{
    private:
    char name;
    int health;
    char level;
    int coins;
}

Q2. What are the advantages of encapsulation? --> The following are the advantages
of encapsulation :- 
1. Data hiding as other classes will not be able to access the private data members.
2. encapsulated code is better for unit testing.
3. We can make the class read only by using encapsulation and encapsulation also make the code readability better.
4. We can hide the internal information using the encapsulation which is better for security reason.

Inheritance --> the process of inheriting the properties and behaviors from existing class to new class. Lets understand Inheritance using real world example lets create a class of cars which has properties like top-speed, milage, number of tyres, fuel type and behaviors like accelerate, brake, move left, move right. There are two cars one ford f350 and tesla cyber truck but both are cars so both of them same properties and methods, the both have top speed milage etc and methods like accelerate, brake etc. So, we do not have to write properties and methods again for each new car we add they can all inherit common properties from the parent class and if there is any other property we can add that to the specific class.

Super class --> The class whose properties are inherited by sub class are know as super class/base class/parent class
Sub class --> The class that inherit properties from another class is known as sub class/child class.

The following is the syntax used for Inheritance

class className : mode_of_inheritance parent_class{

}

mode of inheritance --> can be public, private or protected

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Access of data member | mode of inheritance  | member access in sub class |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|       public           |       public         |           public           |
|       public           |       private        |           private          |
|       public           |       protected      |           protected        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|       private          |       public         |         not accessible     |
|       private          |       private        |         not accessible     |
|       private          |       protected      |         not accessible     |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|       protected        |       public         |           protected        |
|       protected        |       private        |           private          |
|       protected        |       protected      |           protected        |

private data members of any class can not be inherited by any class;

There are five types of inheritance
1. single inheritance --> one class can extend functionality to another class. There is only one parent and one child relation.

2. multi-level inheritance --> When a class is derived from a parent class and this derived class becomes the parent class for a new class it is known as multi level inheritance.

3. multiple inheritance --> when a child class has more than one parent or when a class is derived from more than one super class it is known as multiple inheritance.

4. hierarchical inheritance --> when one class serves as a parent for more than one derived class it is known as hierarchical inheritance;

5. hybrid inheritance --> combination of more than one type of inheritance

XXX. Inheritance Ambiguity --> 

lets assume there is a class A which has a function member named print and there is a function B which also has a function member named print, and we created a class C by using multiple inheritance from class A and class B. but now we have two function member named as print how we will be able to get the one which is inherited from class B, the answer is by using the scope resolution operator(::);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polymorphism --> Polymorphism is made up of two words poly means many ans morph means forms, so one thing that can exist in multiple forms is known as Polymorphism.

for example -> humare pita ji, for his mom he is his son, for bua ji he is his brother, for my mom he is his husband, for me he is my father. same person but different title.

There are two types of Polymorphism
1. Compile-time Polymorphism;
2. Run-time Polymorphism;
