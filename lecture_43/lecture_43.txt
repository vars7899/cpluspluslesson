Encapsulation --> Wrapping up the data members and function members under the 
same unit is known as encapsulation. 

Q1. what is fully encapsulated class --> A class in which all the data members 
are private and can be accessed only within the class. The following is the an 
example of fully encapsulated class.

class Hero{
    private:
    char name;
    int health;
    char level;
    int coins;
}

Q2. What are the advantages of encapsulation? --> The following are the advantages
of encapsulation :- 
1. Data hiding as other classes will not be able to access the private data members.
2. encapsulated code is better for unit testing.
3. We can make the class read only by using encapsulation and encapsulation also make the code readability better.
4. We can hide the internal information using the encapsulation which is better for security reason.
